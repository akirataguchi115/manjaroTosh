# manjaroTosh
Instructions and scripts to make your Manjaro Plasma KDE look like current macOS (Big Sur 11.1).

Pure KWin installation script can't be provided due to KWin community being so small and the documentation is shatter across the web thus being very abstract on some niche topics f.ex. how to configure existing KWin desktop effects from terminal. The first part of this installation tutorial is mostly based on [this video](https://youtu.be/DX_gQTQLUZc). The reason I'm making text based tutorial is because nobody has the time for a 18 minutes lasting video about some GUI bs.
